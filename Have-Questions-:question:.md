It is critical to understand the kind of question you might have. Since Windows Community Toolkit receives volumes of issues and feature requests regularly; we want to make sure that every question receives an answer as soon as possible. Therefore, please do not open issues for general support questions and keep our GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. 

There is a much better chance of getting your question answered on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows-community-toolkit) where questions should be tagged with the tag windows-community-toolkit. 

If there is any question related to missing documentation, please file an issue instead at [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/issues/new)
