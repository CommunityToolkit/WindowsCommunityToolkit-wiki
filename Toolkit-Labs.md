# 🧪 Let's Experiment Together! 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬

Community Toolkit Labs is a place for rapidly prototyping ideas and gathering community feedback. It is an incubation space where the developer community can come together to work on new ideas before thinking about _final quality gates_ and _ship cycles_. Developers can focus on the scenarios and usage of their features before finalizing docs, samples, and tests required to ship a complete idea within the Toolkit.

## 🔬 Current Experiments

Below is a list of the current repositories we have for current experiments. Check out each one for more details.

- [Intelligent APIs](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-IntelligentAPIs) aim to make machine learning (ML) tasks easier for UWP developers to leverage in their applications without needing ML expertise or creating a new model.

## 🚧 Labs NuGet Feed

We have a dedicated NuGet feed for Toolkit Labs in our public DevOps package feed. You can find out more about using these types of feeds on the [[Preview Packages]] page.

## ❓ Why Labs? 

As the Community Toolkit has grown, we've raised the bar on the quality of our code and the process we use for vetting new features being introduced. While this helps our community know they're getting quality tested items in each of our releases; it can slow down the pace that we can innovate at.

Innovation as been the life of the Community Toolkit, without it we wouldn't be here! Rapidly prototyping ideas, gathering community feedback, and shipping things folks need has been instrumental to how the Toolkit works. For this reason, we've introduced `Community Toolkit Labs`.

Labs will be a place where we can incubate and work on new features in a safe space outside our normal code base and _ship cycles_. It'll be easier to get started working on code and collaborating with others before having to worry about the docs, samples, and tests required to ship a full fleshed-out idea and feature within the Toolkit. Especially when you're just starting with a prototype!

Labs are setup with a lower barrier to entry, so a developer can get initial feedback, work more on an idea with others, and gather feedback from a broader set of developers.

In the future, we plan to have a central repository for each Toolkit's technology for smaller features and controls to be proposed, incubate, and worked in with the community. Be on the lookout for more info about updates to this new experience after the Windows Community Toolkit's 7.1 release.
