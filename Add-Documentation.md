Documentation is required when adding, removing, or updating a control or an API. To update the documentation, you must submit a separate Pull Request in the [WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs) (use the master branch).

 **Both Pull Requests (code and docs) must be approved by the core team before either one is merged.**

Make sure to update both Pull Requests with a link to each other.

If adding a new documentation page:
* Copy the [documentation template](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/.template.md) and follow the same format.
* Update the [Table of Content](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/toc.md) to point to the new page
