It is critical to understand the kind of questions you might have. Since Windows Community Toolkit receives volumes of issues regularly; we want to make certain that every question receives an answer as soon as possible. Therefore, please do not open issues for general support questions and keep our GitHub issues for [[Bug Fixes]] and [[Feature Requests]]. You can use [[Discussions]] instead to start general conversations with our team and community.

Though, there may be a much better chance of getting your question answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows-community-toolkit) where questions should be tagged with the tag `windows-community-toolkit`. You can also chat with community members about the project in our [UWP Community Discord](https://discord.gg/zBA5aCn) channel.

If there is any question related to missing documentation, please file an issue instead at [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/issues/new) üìù
