# Join-the-Toolkit-Organization


The Windows Community Toolkit (WCT) team is always encouraging new talent and hard work to lead by example and inspire the community to expand. In the WCT each member is highly encouraged toward bringing change and to lead by example. Making a difference in the community can be as simple as evangelizing UWP apps for Windows 10 and the WCT, enhancing the toolkit itself to help sustain their projects & others, or helping innovating on new ideas. All the creativity, contribution, and input are valued.

Your membership is assessed solely based on your continuous and active participation. Therefore, you can join the Windows Community Toolkit [Members list](https://github.com/orgs/windows-toolkit/teams/toolkitteam/members) by displaying enthusiasm and commitment towards the project by performing various tasks. Once our team sees you participating and contributing continuously whether it's submitting the PR or providing any insight to resolve an open issue will automatically enable you for candidacy as a member of the Toolkit team. Active participation across the repository and/or contributing significant features throughout one or more releases weigh heavily in these decisions.

**How can anyone recognize the Windows Community Toolkit member?**
Your active participation by consistent contribution and desire to help grow the project will speak for itself :raised_hands: 

We are rooting for you!! Hope to see you in the members list very soon :rocket: :rocket:
