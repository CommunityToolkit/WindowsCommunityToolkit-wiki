Before you proceed any further to explore other documents and learn how to contribute to this amazing community, it is good to understand what Widows Community Toolkit is all about.

The foundation of the **Windows Community Toolkit** is simplicity.

A developer should be able to quickly and easily learn to use the API.

Simplicity and a low barrier to entry are must-have features of every API. If you have any second thoughts about the complexity of the design, it is almost always much better to cut the feature from the current release and spend more time to get the design right for the next release.
You can always add to an API, you cannot ever remove anything from one. If the design does not feel right, and you ship it anyway, you are likely to regret having done so.

That's why many of the guidelines of the documentation are obvious and serve only one purpose: Simplicity:sparkles:
