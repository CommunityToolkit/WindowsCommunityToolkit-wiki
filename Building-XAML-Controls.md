We encourage developers to follow the following guidelines when submitting Pull Requests for controls:

* Your control must be usable and efficient with the keyboard only.
* Tab order must be logical.
* Focused controls must be visible.
* Action must be triggered when hitting the Enter key.
* Do not use custom colors but instead rely on theme colors so high contrasts themes can be used with your control.
* Add AutomationProperties.Name on all controls to define the controlâ€™s purpose (Name is minimum, but there are some other things too that can help the screen reader).
* Don't use the same Name on two different elements unless they have different control types.
* Use Narrator Dev mode (Launch Narrator [WinKey+Enter], then CTRL+F12) to test the screen reader experience. 
* Is the information sufficient, meaningful, and helps the user navigate and understand your control.
* Ensure that you have run your XAML file changes through Xaml Styler (version 2.3+), which can be downloaded from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NicoVermeir.XAMLStyler). Do not worry about the settings for this as they are set at the project level (settings.xamlstyler).

This is to help as part of our effort to build an accessible toolkit (starting with 1.2)
