* DO NOT require that users perform any extensive initialization before they can start programming basic scenarios.
* DO provide good defaults for all values associated with parameters, options, etc.
* DO ensure that APIs are intuitive and can be successfully used in basic scenarios without referring to the reference documentation.
* DO communicate incorrect usage of APIs as soon as possible.
* DO design an API by writing code samples for the main scenarios. Only then, you define the object model that supports those code samples.
* DO NOT use regions. DO use partial classes instead.
* DO declare static dependency properties at the top of their file.
* DO NOT seal controls.
* DO use extension methods over static methods where possible.
* DO NOT return true or false to give success status. Throw exceptions if there was a failure.
* DO use verbs like GET.
* DO NOT use verbs that are not already used like fetch.
