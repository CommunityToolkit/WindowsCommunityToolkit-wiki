# The Windows Community Toolkit Wiki

This repo is the home of the [Windows Community Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/wiki).

ðŸš¨ Changes approved and commited to this repo automatically are pushed to the main Wiki, so please use this repo to suggest and make changes vs. editing the Wiki directly.

This repo contains Documentation and Guidance for the Windows Community Toolkit Project itself. This pertains to:

 - How the project is maintained
 - How contributions are accepted
 - How to make contributions
 - How to build and work on different aspects of the project
 - Deeper technical documentation about the codebase or architecture of the project itself

This repo also serves as a public discussion area for issues related to the project governance itself and how the Windows Community Toolkit operates. This leaves the main repo open for issues pertaining specifically to bugs and feature requests on the library itself. If you are having a technical problem with the Toolkit please follow the guidance in this Wiki about how to [file an issue](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/wiki/Submitting-an-Issue).

If you would like to propose any suggestions or changes to specific parts of the guidance in this repo or the project operation itself, please file an issue here.

We also welcome any Pull Requests to this repo with improvements to our Windows Community Toolkit developer guidance and guidelines.
