The [Features list](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/toc.md#controls) refers to all the currently available features that can be found in the Windows Community Toolkit. 

Most of the features should work with the 17763 SDK (1809) and above (as of version 7.0); however, refer to the [specific documentation](https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitdocs) on each feature for more information.
